This directory contains callable launchers for all the scripts
of the project. The purpose of the launchers is to set appropriate
paths to libraries such as Python modules or R packages before the 
scripts are started by their appropriate interpreters.

The launchers can be automatically generated by the script in the `gen` 
folder.
