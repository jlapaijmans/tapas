Dependencies
============

To use the scripts in this folder, the following dependencies must be
installed on your computer:

* R
* R packages:
  - ggplot2
  - gridExtra
  - (testthat) (to run unit tests)

* Python 3

Setting up the shell for work
=============================

The lib/ folder contains the R package `docopt` and the Python package
`docopt` (yes, its two times the same name). If this package is not 
installed for R and Python on your computer, you need to add the
`lib/` folder to R's and Python's seach path by source'ing the 
`shell-init.sh` script in each shell you use for executing some of
the scripts in this toolset.

It's important that you don't execute the `shell-init.sh` script like
you would normally do (by typing `./shell-init.sh` into your shell),
but that you type `source shell-init.sh`.

The manual
==========

The manual lies in the `manual/` folder. Open the file `manual.html`
with your browser.
