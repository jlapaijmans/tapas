This folder contains the manual sources and the examples. 

The manual is written in a literate programming style with executable examples
weaved into the text. It can be compiled from the markdown-formatted chapters
in the `manual/src/` folder by using the script 

    gen-html.sh

In the process, the program calls written in the manual are executed and the
output is weaved into the manual text. Samtools and the mapper BWA is needed
for the examples and Pandoc is needed to convert the resulting Markdown
document into HTML.

The result is written as HTML pages to the `TAPAS/docs` folder, where `TAPAS`
is the installation folder of TAPAS.
