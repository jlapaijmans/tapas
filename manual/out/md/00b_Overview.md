Package overview
================

**TAPAS (Testing Aligner Performance for Ancient Samples)** is a software
package written in Python and R which enables you to test how well parameters of
NGS short read mappers perform when mapping reads to a reference. The reads can
be subjected to artificial damage to simulate evolutionary distance and chemical
alteration of ancient DNA samples.

Generate reads from a sample genome
-----------------------------------

Refer to the section [Generating sample reads](#generating-sample-reads).

Mutate the sample reads
-----------------------

Simulate chemical damage and evolutionary distance. Read the section
[Mutation of reads](#mutation-of-reads)
