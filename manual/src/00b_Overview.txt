**TAPAS (Testing Aligner Performance for Ancient Samples)** is a software
package written in Python and R which enables you to test how well parameters of
NGS short read mappers perform when mapping reads to a reference. The reads can
be subjected to artificial damage to simulate evolutionary distance and chemical
alteration of ancient DNA samples. 

Installation
============

See the section <a href=00b_shell-prerequisites.txt>Dependencies of the scripts</a>
to learn about the installation process of TAPAS

Workflow
========

TAPAS can be used to generate artificial NGS reads from a given reference
genome, introduce mutations into them which follow a user-defined pattern and
evaluate the mapping success of the reads with a user-supplied short read
mapper.

See the section about [Input files](00c_input-files.html) to see
which files must be supplied prior to the analysis.

In the following, the workflow is outlined, where links are provided to manual
chapters which give more detail on each step. 

 * **Prepare the reference genome.** See section
   [Genome Preparation](01_genome-preparation.html)
 * **Generate artificial reads from a sample genome.** See 
   [Read generation](02_read-generation.html)
 * **Mutations** must be introduced into the reads to mimic chemical damage of
   *ancient DNA* and evolutionary distance of the reads to the reference. Read
   the section about [Read mutation](03_read-mutation.html) for more
   information
 * The mutated artificial reads are **mapped** back to the reference from which
   they originated. This simulates the process of mapping *ancient DNA* reads to
   a recent reference genome. TAPAS allows for comparison of different mapping
   parameters in terms of mapping success. Section 
   [Mapping](04_mapping.html) provides details on how the mapping
   commands and parameters are provided to TAPAS.
 * The read mapping yields one SAM file for every mapping parameter set tested.
   The section [SAM parsing](05_sam-parsing.html) provides
   information on how the mapping positions of the artificial reads can be
   compared to their known, true, positions in the reference to determine
   measures of mapping accuracy like **sensitivity and specificity**.
 * Finally, the obtained accuracy values can be analysed to determine the
   **importance of a certain mapping parameter choice** for the mapping success.
   The section [Parameter influence](06_parameter-influence.html) provides
   details.

Apart from that, the **Appendix** lists additional information:

 * All commands from the tutorial, collated into one script for overview:
   [Appendix A1](A01_workflow.html)
 * An overview of all scripts provided by TAPAS: [Appendix A2](A02_scripts.html)
 * How to put together artificial FASTQ files from their parts (1) nucleotide
   strings, (2) quality strings and (3) read names to allow for more
   fine-grained read generation and incorporation of external tools: [Appendix
   A3: Advanced Read generation](A03_advanced_read-generation.html)
 * [Appendix B: Glossary](B99_glossary.html)
