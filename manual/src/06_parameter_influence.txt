title: 
  - Comparing multiple mapper runs
---

The file `data/4/partab` holds the information which parameters were
used for which mapping run. By relating the output measures like
sensitivity, specificity or balanced accuracy to these parameters, the
influence of individual parameters can be assessed.

First step is to combine the output measures of all runs:

To this effect, to each of the `.performance`-files (contain
sensitivity, specificity, bcr) generated in the last section, the run
number is added as a separate column, then the `.performance`-files of
all runs are concatenated to one table.  Because the run number was
added before, the origin of all values is still clear.

```{.sh}
# Add the run number to each .performance file
for f in data/5/*.performance; do
    i=$(basename ${f%.performance})

    scripts/add_const_column "$f" runidx "$i" \
        > "data/6/${i}.performance"
done

# Concatenate all tables, but print the header line only once.
scripts/cat_tables data/6/*.performance \
                 > data/6/performance

cat data/6/performance | column -t
```

Next, the parameter values belonging to the run indices are joined in, 
appending the parameter columns to `data/6/parameters` itself.

```{.sh}
scripts/merge -a data/6/performance runidx \
              -b data/4/partab      runidx \
              --all-a-cols --all-b-cols --all-a \
           | scripts/write_later data/6/performance

head data/6/performance | column -t
```

The value of one parameter can be plotted against some measure. The
following command shows plots where the X and Y axis are free to
choose. If multiple runs yield a similar score on the Y axis, their
data points are merged to form one bigger dot on the plot. Here all
numbers are rounded to one significant digit, because only 8 mapping
runs are compared in this example. Therefore results must be
aggregated coarsely to demonstrate the results.

```{.sh}
# Plot n versus BCR
scripts/plot_parameter_effects --signif 1 data/6/performance n bcr \
                               --plot-format png \
                               data/6/n.png

# Plot k versus BCR
scripts/plot_parameter_effects --signif 1 data/6/performance k bcr \
                               --plot-format png \
                               data/6/k.png
```

View the plots: 

<img class="plot" src="../../data/6/n.png" width=500 /> 

<img class="plot" src="../../data/6/k.png" width=500 />

 It can be seen that n seems to have an impact on the BCR whereas k
 does not. The BCR rises and falls again because the gain in
 sensitivity is offset by the loss in specificity if n rises too high.

However, for the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial the number of
reads to map is very small. To draw serious conclusions about the influence of
mapper parameters, large numbers of reads must be mapped and
statistical inference methods must be employed.
