Genome Preparation
==================

 
Record index table
------------------
The FASTA record identifiers must be written in a table.
This enables to assign different chromosomes to the same organism
later on in the analysis (Section 5)

In this example, the reads stem from our sample organism
'volpertinger':

First, index the genome using samtools:
```{.sh}
samtools faidx data/genome/sample.fasta
```

```{.sh}
scripts/genome/mfasta-idlist.sh data/genome/sample.fasta.fai volpertinger \
    > data/1/sample.recids
head data/1/sample.recids
```

The second parameter is optional, but handy if the target genome is
comprised of multiple FASTA records. It adds a column called
"organism" which holds the string of the second argument (in this
case, "sample"). The resulting table can be used to associate all the
FASTA records of this FASTA file to the same organism in subsequent
analysis steps.
